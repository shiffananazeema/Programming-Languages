 - SQLAlchemy is a library that facilitates the communication between 
Python programs and databases. Most of the times, this library is 
used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool that translates Python 
classes to tables on relational databases and automatically converts 
function calls to SQL statements.

 - ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a programming technique for converting 
data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. 
Usually, the type system used in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Python 
contains non-scalar types. These cannot be expressed as primitive types such as 
integers and strings. Hence, the OO programmer has to convert objects in scalar
data to interact with backend database. However, data types in most of the database 
products such as Oracle, MySQL, etc., are primary.
